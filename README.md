# Vowel Count

[https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ff3102c1bad923760001f3](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ff3102c1bad923760001f3)

DESCRIPTION:

- Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
- We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).
- The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

```py
def get_count(sentence):
    pass
```

### PYTHON SOLUTION:

```py
def get_count(sentence):
    return sum(1 for v in sentence if v in 'aeiou')
```

```py
def get_count(sentence):
    return sum(v in 'aeiou' for v in sentence)
```

```py
import re

def get_count(sentence):
    return len(re.findall('[aeiou]', sentence, re.IGNORECASE))
```

<summary>2. Highest and Lowest </summary>

# Highest and Lowest

[https://www.codewars.com/kata/554b4ac871d6813a03000035](https://www.codewars.com/kata/554b4ac871d6813a03000035)

DESCRIPTION:

- In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples

- high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
- high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
- high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"

Notes

* All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
* There will always be at least one number in the input string.
* Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

```py
def high_and_low(numbers):
    # ...
    return numbers
```

### PYTHON SOLUTION:

```py
def high_and_low(numbers):
    list_nums = numbers.split(' ')
    sorted_nums = sorted(map(int, list_nums))
    return '{} {}'.format(sorted_nums[-1], sorted_nums[0])
```

```py
def high_and_low(numbers):
    list_num = [int(num) for num in numbers.split(' ')]
    return "{} {}".format(max(list_num), min(list_num))
```

```py
def high_and_low(numbers):
    list_num = [int(num) for num in numbers.split(' ')]
    return "%i %i" % (max(list_num),min(list_num))
```

```py
def high_and_low(numbers):
    nums = sorted(numbers.split(), key=int)
    return '{} {}'.format(nums[-1], nums[0])

DESCRIPTION:

Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

```py
def even_or_odd(number):
    pass
```

### PYTHON SOLUTION:

```py
def even_or_odd(number):
    return "Even" if number%2==0 else "Odd"
```

```py
def even_or_odd(number):
    return "Odd" if number%2 else "Even"
```

```py
def even_or_odd(number):
  return ["Even", "Odd"][number % 2]
```
